# FinTree

**Project overview:** Fintree is a web platform to make it easy for project developers to get finance for REDD+ projects from the global financial network. We are focused on building:

* An extensive knowledge repository of all the financial support programs in one place.
* An online monitoring system and a dashboard from the publicly available data about the aid provided by different programs to different countries.

In future we thrive to build:

* A single application system to apply to different support organisations for financial aid.
* A data driven recommendation system to help project developers to know which organisations are mostly likely to support them.

Further details can be found in our [research resources page](https://www.notion.so/Research-99b5d34d0ca1488a984b429556ea6a27).

# Problems we intend to solve:

* Co-ordination of finance between different entities.
* Relieve excess centralisation in the network.
* Information sharing between the donors


# Values guiding the research

* Transparency: Open processes for open discussions.
* Inclusivity: Diverse points of view make discussions better.
* Privacy: It’s about what you say, whoever you are.
* Topic-neutral: It’s about how you discuss, not what you discuss.
