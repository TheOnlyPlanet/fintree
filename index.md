# Project overview

Our work aims to make it easy for project developers to get finance for REDD+ projects from the global financial network. We are focused on building:

* An extensive knowledge repository of all the financial support programs in one place.
* An online monitoring system and a dashboard from the publicly available data about the aid provided by different programs to different countries.

In future we thrive to build:

* A single application system to apply to different support organisations for financial aid.
* A data driven recommendation system to help project developers to know which organisations are mostly likely to support them.

Further details can be found in our [research resources page](research.md).
